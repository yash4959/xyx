# üìò Week 2 Task ‚Äì BabySoC Fundamentals & Functional Modelling

## Objective
To build a solid understanding of SoC fundamentals and practice functional modelling of the BabySoC using simulation tools such as **Icarus Verilog** and **GTKWave**.

## PART 1 (Conceptual understanding)

This project explores the design of a compact, open-source System on Chip (SoC) centered around the RVMYTH RISC-V processor core. The SoC incorporates a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for stable and precise clock generation, along with a 10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) to interface with external analog devices. By converting digital outputs to analog signals, the DAC enables BabySoC to communicate with systems like audio equipment, displays, or other analog-compatible hardware. Built using Sky130 technology, this SoC provides a robust educational platform for learning about SoC design, digital-to-analog interfacing, and embedded system experimentation.

## üíª What is System-on-Chips (SoCs) ? 

A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** is an integrated circuit (IC) that combines most or all the essential components of a complete electronic system onto a single chip. Unlike traditional electronic designs, where separate chips handle different functions (like CPU, memory, and peripherals), an SoC integrates these into one compact unit. 

SoCs are widely used in modern electronics, including smartphones, tablets, IoT devices, embedded systems, and automotive electronics, due to their high performance, low power consumption, and small size.

## üïí Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)

A **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)** is a control system that produces an output signal whose phase is aligned with a reference input signal. The output frequency is synchronized to the input, and the phase difference between them is either zero or a fixed constant.

**Main Components of a PLL:**  
1. **Phase Detector (PD):** Compares the reference input with the oscillator output and generates an error signal representing the phase difference.  
2. **Loop Filter:** A low-pass filter that smooths the error signal to generate a control voltage.  
3. **Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO):** Adjusts its frequency according to the control voltage to match the reference frequency.  

**Operation:**  
- The PLL continuously adjusts the output to "lock" onto the input signal, maintaining a steady phase relationship.  
- Some PLLs use a frequency divider in the feedback loop to generate an output frequency that is a multiple or fraction of the input reference frequency.  

**Why Not Always Use Off-Chip Clocks?**  
- **Signal Delay:** Routing a single clock across a large chip can introduce delays, affecting timing.  
- **Clock Jitter:** Off-chip clocks can fluctuate slightly, causing synchronization errors.  
- **Varying Frequency Needs:** Different modules may require different clock rates (e.g., one at 200 MHz, another at 100 MHz).  
- **Crystal Tolerances:** Quartz crystals have small frequency deviations (measured in ppm), affecting precision.  
- **Temperature Dependence:** Crystal frequency may shift with temperature changes, impacting stability.  
- **Aging Effects:** Crystals slowly change frequency over time, contributing to total timing error.

## üîä Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)

A **Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)** converts a digital signal, represented in binary form, into a corresponding analog signal.

**Key Points:**  
1. **Digital Representation:** The input is a set of bits (0s and 1s) that encode information digitally.  
2. **Structure:**  
   - DACs have multiple digital input lines and a single analog output.  
   - The number of input bits is typically a power of two (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16).  

**Common DAC Types:**  
1. **Weighted Resistor DAC:**  
   - Uses resistors of varying values to scale each input bit proportionally, converting the binary input to a voltage.  

2. **R-2R Ladder DAC:**  
   - Employs a repeating resistor network of two values (R and 2R) to simplify design and scale easily for multiple bits.  

**Functionality:**  
- DACs allow digital systems, like a CPU, to communicate with real-world analog devices such as speakers, displays, or sensors.  
- They play a crucial role in bridging the gap between digital computation and analog output in embedded systems and SoCs.
