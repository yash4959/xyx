## 📖 About the Program  

The **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program (VSD)** is India’s largest **open-source silicon design initiative**, enabling **3500+ participants** to take a design from **RTL → GDSII → Tapeout** using **SkyWater 130nm PDK** and open-source EDA tools.  

Over **10 weeks**, participants gain hands-on exposure to:  
- Digital design using **Verilog & SystemVerilog**  
- **Synthesis & Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)** with Yosys + Icarus Verilog  
- **Physical Design Flow** using OpenLane & Magic  
- Timing analysis, power optimization, and floorplanning  
- Final **SoC Tapeout** with Efabless & SkyWater  

This repo documents my **week-by-week journey** with learnings, tasks, and project work.
